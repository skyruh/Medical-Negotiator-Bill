## 😤 The Problem
Medical billing is complex, opaque, and often riddled with errors. Patients frequently overpay because they can't verify:
1.  **Complexity**: Medical codes (CPT/ICD) are intentionally confusing.
2.  **Opacity**: Prices vary wildly between hospitals for the *same* procedure.
3.  **Errors**: Up to **80%** of medical bills contain errors or overcharges.

## 💡 The Solution
**MedBill AI** is an intelligent agent that fights for your financial health. By leveraging **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash**, it parses your complex medical bills, cross-references line items with standardized government (CGHS) rates, and instantly flags discrepancies.

> **"Don't just pay it. Verify it."**

## ✨ Key Features

*   **📄 Universal Parsing**: Upload any medical bill (PDF, JPG, PNG) – even scanned or crumped ones.
*   **🧠 Gemini-Powered Intelligence**: Uses advanced vision + text multimodal AI to extract line items with high precision.
*   **⚖️ Rate Benchmarking**: Automatically compares charged amounts against the **Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS)** rate card.
*   **🚩 Discrepancy Detection**: Instantly highlights potential overcharges in a clear, easy-to-read report.
*   **🔒 Privacy First**: Your data is processed securely.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React (Vite) – *Fast, responsive UI.*
*   **Backend**: Node.js (Express) – *Robust API handling.*
*   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash) – *The brain behind the parsing.*
*   **Styling**: Vanilla CSS – *Clean, custom, lightweight.*

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get MedBill AI running locally in minutes!

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   A Google Cloud API Key with access to Gemini API (`GEMINI_API_KEY`)

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skyruh/Medical-Negotiator-Bill
cd medical-bill-app
```

### 2. 🔥 Backend Setup
Navigate to the server folder and fire it up.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

**Configure Environment:**
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

**Start Server:**
```bash
node server.js
```
*Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`*

### 3. 🎨 Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and launch the client.

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
*Client opens at `http://localhost:5173`*

## 📸 How It Works

1.  **Upload**: User drags & drops a hospital bill.
2.  **Analyze**: System sends file to backend -> Gemini AI extracts structural data + prices.
3.  **Verify**: Backend compares extracted prices with `super_speciality_rates.json`.
4.  **Report**: Frontend displays a "Flagged Items" table showing the difference between *Billed Amount* and *Fair Rate*.
